<p align="center"><samp>Wannabe photographer, RPGist, coffee addict (the coffee I offered you and you declined was delish u.u) and seriously addicted to psychological horror movies and synthwave music.</samp></p>

<p align="center"><samp>Oh, I'm also a programmer. I guess I forgot about this tiny little detail.</samp></p>

    <b>What do I do?</b>
  </summary>
  <p><i>Yes, I'm well aware that's why you came here, don't you worry. Here are some important info on what I do professionally.</a> o/</i></p>
  
  * I speak Java fluently
  
  * I also speak portuguese and english fluently

  * I use VSCode as my IDE. Yes, VSCode and Java. <i>If I had a nickel for every time someone asked me that...</i>

  * I'm currently working for IBM, as part of the Itaú-Unibanco modernization program

  * I'm familiar with Spring Framework and its children, such as Boot, Cloud, Security, Data and Actuate

  * I'm also familiar with microservices development, currently working with banking systems

  * I know my way around OpenShift 4.x fairly well, especially integrated with Fabric8 for Maven

  * I'm a containers and Kubernetes specialist, [certified by Red Hat](https://rhtapps.redhat.com/certifications/badge/verify/6YXJWV5QF4CBIAVCL54LK4SQAMAEQU3CUPSQX2KSDXT6RW46LQ33TZNCC5VGOAYPFY7HVVIGB5XKUTI5W6QLZX6UMV3D6ILAY7YA4GY=)

  * With that in mind, I'm also familiar with Docker, Podman, Skopeo and Buildah

  * Speaking of OpenShift and Containers, I've created a [free course about OpenShift and Containers](https://github.com/mentoria-openshift) for those that would like to check it out. It's in portuguese though 

  * I like to play here and there with Watson (check out [The Grand Prognosticator](https://github.com/thaalesalves/grand-prognosticator))
  
  * I'm almost giving up WhatsApp and using Kafka for messaging. Too bad my friends won't take the idea seriously :disappointed:

  * And, between my hobbies, I like developing mods for TESV: Skyrim

    <b>If I have hobbies?</b>
  </summary>
  <p><i>Oh boy, do I have hobbies? My hobby is having a bunch of hobbies...! Well, that might not be true, but I am an interesting person, alright? :rage:</i></p>
  
  * Practicing new technologies
  
  * Listening to [my music](https://open.spotify.com/user/ga8jrbgtpkhrz6mzb9lbu6sak), watching [my movies](https://letterboxd.com/thaalesalves/), reading [my books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63327012-thales) and playing [my games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/guaruaru)
  
  * Playing an RPG every now and then
  
  * Speaking of RPG, here's a system a friend and I made, based on Storyteller: [Amaranth](https://amaranth.thalesalv.es/)
  
  * Yes, I'm talking about table-top RPGs. But, as Amaranth suggests, I indeed am an <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/User:Thaalesalves">Elder Scrolls fanatic</a>. Please call me a lorebuff. :relieved:
  
  * And that's why I have [The Grand Prognosticator](https://github.com/thaalesalves/grand-prognosticator): to roll dice, generate sheets and list system rules :robot:
  
  * But we can also mention the [UESPWiki bot](https://gitlab.com/thaalesalves/DiscordBot), that consults the wiki and shows info on TESLore

  * As mentioned earlier, I love devoping mods. After saying I develop mods for Skyrim, mentioning Amaranth and talking about my RPG bot, I don't need to say TES is my favorite game franchise, do I? I do? What if I told you I have a tattoo with a quote by Vivec? Does that make it more obvious?
  
  * Did anyone say coffee? I want mine pure. A yellow and red catuaí blend toasted with nuts, please :relieved:
