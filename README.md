    <b>What do I do?</b>
  </summary>
  <p><i>Yes, I'm well aware that's why you came here, don't you worry. Here are some important info on what I do professionally.</a> o/</i></p>

  * I speak Java fluently

  * I also speak portuguese and english fluently

  * I use VSCode as my IDE. Yes, VSCode and Java. <i>If I had a nickel for every time someone asked me that...</i>

  * I'm currently working for PrimeIT as a software developer

  * I'm familiar with Spring Framework and its children, such as Boot, Cloud, Security, Data and Actuate

  * I'm also familiar with microservices development, currently working with banking systems

  * And, with that in mind, I obviously love AI. There's a [repo](https://github.com/thaalesalves/ai-games-research) I use for AI stuff such as datasets as well as Jupyter notebooks on how to train and use GPT-2, GPT-Neo and GPT-J models

  * Expanding on that, I'm working on an AI-powered RPG game, [MoirAI](https://github.com/moirairpg). This has been my largest and dearest pet project. AI is very interesting, isn't it?

  * I'm almost giving up WhatsApp and using Kafka for messaging. Too bad my friends won't take the idea seriously :disappointed:
