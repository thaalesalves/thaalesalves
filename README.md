<p align="center"><samp>Wannabe photographer, RPGist, coffee addict (the coffee I offered you and you declined was delish u.u) and seriously addicted to psychological horror movies and synthwave music.</samp></p>

<p align="center"><samp>Oh, I'm also a programmer. I guess I forgot about this tiny little detail.</samp></p>

  <summary>
    <b>What do I do?</b>
  </summary>
  <p><i>Yes, I'm well aware that's why you came here, don't you worry. Here are some important info on what I do professionally.</a> o/</i></p>
  
  * I speak Java fluently
  
  * I also speak portuguese and english fluently

  * I use VSCode as my IDE. Yes, VSCode and Java. <i>If I had a nickel for every time someone asked me that...</i>

  * I'm currently working for IBM, as part of the Itaú-Unibanco modernization program

  * I'm familiar with Spring Framework and its children, such as Boot, Cloud, Security, Data and Actuate

  * I'm also familiar with microservices development, currently working in baking systems

  * OpenShift FTW. I'm familiar with OCP4 and OCP3, having done the specialist course for both versions. Currently working on the certification

  * I like to play here and there with Watson (check out [The Grand Prognosticator](https://github.com/thaalesalves/grand-prognosticator))
  
  * Containerization is life, and if you disagree, I pity you :rage:

  * With that in mind, I'm also familiar with Docker, Podman, Skopeo and Buildah
  
  * I'm almost giving up WhatsApp and using Kafka for messaging. Too bad my friends won't take the idea seriously :disappointed:

  <summary>
    <b>If I have hobbies?</b>
  </summary>
  <p><i>Oh boy, do I have hobbies? My hobby is having a bunch of hobbies...! Well, that might not be true, but I am an interesting person, alright? :rage:</i></p>
  
  * Practicing new technologies
  
  * Listening to [my music](https://open.spotify.com/user/ga8jrbgtpkhrz6mzb9lbu6sak), watching [my movies](https://letterboxd.com/thaalesalves/), reading [my books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63327012-thales) and playing [my games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/guaruaru)
  
  * Playing an RPG every now and then
  
  * Speaking of RPG, here's a system a friend and I made, based on Storyteller: [Amaranth](https://amaranth.thalesalv.es/)
  
  * Yes, I'm talking about table-top RPGs. But, as Amaranth suggests, I indeed am an <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/User:Thaalesalves">Elder Scrolls fanatic</a>. Please call me a lorebuff. :relieved:
  
  * And that's why I have [The Grand Prognosticator](https://github.com/thaalesalves/grand-prognosticator): to roll dice, generate sheets and list system rules :robot:
  
  * But we can also mention the [UESPWiki bot](https://gitlab.com/thaalesalves/DiscordBot), that consults the wiki and shows info on TESLore
  
  * Did anyone say coffee? I want mine pure. A yellow and red catuaí blend toasted with nuts, please :relieved:
